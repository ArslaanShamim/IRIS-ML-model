# IRIS-ML-model
Iris dataset is valuable for educational purposes, The iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, often used for classification tasks. The dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals.

By using the iris dataset, researchers and practitioners can explore various machine learning algorithms, develop classification models, and gain insights into the relationships between different flower attributes.
